            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is obvious to all Mankind, what amazing Circumſtances have attended the Management of State-Affairs, in this our Horizon, for ſeveral years laſt paſt; and it is apparent how reſtleſs the Endeavours of ſeveral Men have bin to Subvert the Government both in Church and State; and notwithſtanding the Loud Acclamations of Popery and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſtill enjoy Peace and Tranquillity, and our Liberties and Priviledges: Let all the Records extant of all the Reigns of our Kings be ſearched, and then it will appear very plain to all perſons whatſoever, that our Sovereign hath been endowed with the Wiſdom of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Patience of a <hi>Job,</hi> and hath been Eminently Influenced by a Divine Hand, that hath Surrounded His Perſon and His Throne, and hath Preſerved Him, and His moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Brother, from Imminent and Apparent Dangers, and His Subjects from Ruin. And that he hath ſuch an Unparalel'd Privy-Council for Wiſdom and Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Loyalty, that their Actions will not only be an Example, but a Wonder to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages. It was a Saying of a late Great and Subtil Polititian, that the King's Prerogative was Law, and the greateſt part of the Law, and that it ought to bear Sway in the firſt place; from thence I infer, whoever he be that yields not ready Complyance to his Princes Commands, becauſe it ſeems to entrench upon his own Self-Intereſt, that very Action demonſtrates him immediately no longer a Subject, but a Rebel. But I crave Pardon for this ſmall Digreſſion: And ſhall, without any farther Deviation from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpoſe, acquaint you with the Reaſon why I dedicate theſe Lines to you, and to you Chiefly (Gentlemen.) I muſt confeſs I have not had that Inſpection into the Cuſtoms of the City, as many others, whoſe Employs and Studies have addicted them more particularly thereto; but what I have read, I have endeavoured to digeſt, and as occaſion hath offered in my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35304:2"/>to bring into Practice; but this I do aver, and there are no Judicious Men but will concenter in my Opinion, that all the Hoſpitals are His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties by Deſcent from his Anceſtors. This being taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is in his Power to Recommend whom he pleaſeth to all places of Truſt in theſe Hoſpitals, without Suſpecting the Loyalty of any of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: That which is expected from them, is a Care of the Prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Revenue for the Poor, that it be not miſapplyed; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Offices, belonging thereto, His Majeſty leaves to them as Governours to Elect, is out of, a Confidence he repoſeth in them, that none but fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be Elected; but the Right of Election he reſerves as Inherent in Himſelf, and at His Pleaſure to Aſſert it. Neither certainly was it ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor (with Humble Submiſſion to better Judgments) do I think it convenient that thoſe that are Governours ſhould have Places of Profit, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Benefit of three Brewers places) becauſe thereby they may be biaſſed; ſo as it may in time be found to be very Prejudicial to the Hoſpitals, for ſeveral reaſons, which Wiſe Men are not ignorant of, but do already foreſee, and as occaſion offers, will declare their Sentiments in due time, which may ſerve to caution ſome Perſons concerned therein. But this I can aſſert, when I had a Concern (tho' not as a Governour) that a poſitive Order was made at a General Court, that no preſent Governours ſhould have any places of Profit.</p>
            <p>A Regulation of ſome of the Affairs, in ſome of his Majeſties Hoſpitals, hath not been only intended, but put in Execution, <hi>viz.</hi> that Affair relating to <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and a Letter of Recommendation of a Perſon, as Drugſter, from His Majeſty, was ſhewn to the Committee, to whom the Management of that Affair was committed: One of the Committee, to ſhew his ready Obedience, did conſent to the immediate Employing of him; and as a farther Teſtimonial, did order ſome Drugs to be ſent; ſo did the other Perſon likewiſe: The whole Committee conſiſting of three, two of them met, the third met not at all. Some Perſons afterwards, being acquainted with what was done, ſeemed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, purely out of ſelf-Intereſt, as manifeſtly will appear; and were pleaſed to intimate to a Perſon of great Worth and Eminency, that it would be a Wrong to the Poor, and very Prejudicial to the Hoſpital; and that His Majeſty was miſinformed, that there was no intention of chooſing a Druggiſt; and by this means endeavoured to have His Majeſty acquainted, in order to the Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Letter: The falſity hereof I ſhall plainly make appear. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court had left the Management of that Affair to a Commitee, and that they ſhould have occaſion to employ a Druggiſt, is moſt certain: But ſome Men were ſo wedded to their ſelf-Intereſt, that <hi>Momus</hi> like, they carp at a ſmall <hi>Errata</hi> in penning of the Letter. But the Gentleman having ſupplyed them with as good Drugs, and as cheap as any Man, as is atteſted under the hands of the Phyſitians, and Chyrurgeons, and Committee intruſted with that Affair, Ought not the King's Letter to have the Preferrence? As a Gentleman undauntedly aſſerted at the late publick Committee, and put them to a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> as they did the <hi>Quondam</hi> Recorder. The Preſident of that Hoſpital declared his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to His Majeſties Letter of Recommendation, but <hi>(Anguis latet in Herbis;)</hi> which is the reaſon ſome oppoſe it vigorouſly and diſingenuouſly; and they are Labouring hard to Stifle it (in <hi>Embrio</hi>) though it is believed they may miſs of their Aim. But from all that hath been Iledged, I infer theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars, which I propoſe to the Serious Conſideration of all Loyal Men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It cannot be imagined that His Majeſty, having granted his Letter of Recommendation, will be eaſily prevailed upon to recal it; and it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed that thoſe that Beg a Boon of the King, will not Implore His Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35304:2"/>for a Knave, or a Fool, or for a Perſon that is not truely Loyal. The main Objections againſt his Majeſties Letter by two or three are theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Firſt, That there is no ſuch Office as a Drugſter. The Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, That His Majeſty hath given the Power of Elections of Officers into the Governours Hands, therefore they will inſiſt on their Loyalty, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on themſelves as competent Judges of who are moſt fit. Theſe are the moſt material Objections, and they may be as eaſily Anſwered; and I do poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aver that it is not the good of the Hoſpital that is aimed at, but Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and this I will now make evidently appear. As to the Firſt, That although there be no ſuch Office yet as Drugſter, they muſt make uſe of one, as they do at St. <hi>Bartholemews</hi> Hoſpital, and why not then of the Perſon recommended by His Majeſty? As to the Second Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, I ſhall accquaint you with one Famous Inſtance, very pertinent to the matter in Hand. There is a Company in the City of <hi>London,</hi> near a Kin to the Gentlemen of the <hi>Paracelſian</hi> Faculty, His Majeſty was pleaſed to give His Royal Grant to an Honeſt Gentleman to be Clerk to the ſaid Company; their former Clerk, who is yet in Poſſeſſion, did prevail with ſeveral of the Court of Aſſiſtants to paſs their Words that they would Petition the King on his behalf, and they did believe they ſhould prevail with His Majeſty to Revoke His Royal Grant; the Petition was accordingly drawn, and they meet at the time and place appointed: But one Gentleman being more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect than the reſt told them, That it was convenient they ſhould firſt Addreſs themſelves to that Honourable and Renowned Perſon, to whom His Majeſty had committed the whole Management of thoſe Affairs: To this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they all Unanimouſly conſented, and accordingly went to him and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Petition, Humbly imploring his Concurrence. He told them they knew His Majeſty had given His Royal Grant for another Perſon, And did wonder with what Confidence they did preſume to go with that Petition, but withal bid thoſe who were preſent to Sign it: He that delivered it made a motion to Sign it, but one amongſt them being more Conſiderate than the reſt whiſpered in his Ear, and deſired him to crave time to conſider of it; which he did, and it was granted; but they have not judged it convenient to meddle in that Affair any farther. From thence I infer, that it is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence for Self-Intereſt to interfere with the Royal Prerogative; but the Proverbial ſaying is truly verified in this Affair, <hi>Auri ſacra fames,</hi> &amp;c. I ſuppoſe ſome have not forgot what his Majeſty was pleaſed to Declare, not many Years ſince, upon urgent Solicitations being made to Him, That he would not part with His Militia for half an hour. Neither will he with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which is one of the Principal Flowers Inherent in the Crown. And who are the fitteſt Objects for His Majeſty to confer his Favours on, but the Court? They are the Sufferers with their Prince in all Emergencies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not they to be firſt gratified? Suppoſe a Treaſurer of any Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital ſhould have Petitioned His Majeſty that a Friend of his might have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any of the Hoſpitals, as a Brewer, Baker, or Druggiſt; would not they have accounted it a great Favour to have had their Suit granted? And will not his Majeſty highly reſent it, that when he recomends any Perſon to any of thoſe Places in any of his own Hoſpitals, that it ſhould be accounted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? And I am of opinion that it is a ſignal Favour of His Majeſty, that he only recommends where he might command: I ſhall only accquaint you (Gentlemen) with ſomewhat that occurs to my Memory and is not very foreign from the Matter in Hand. A Prince of Famous Memory had permitted his Subjects their Freedoms in the exerciſe of Religion, to try what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35304:3"/>Uſe they would make of ſo Royal a Favour, and likewiſe to experiment their Tempers and Inclinations. In a little Proceſs of time they grew Factious, He then gave out his Command, that they ſhould conform to the Government, according as by Law eſtabliſhed. Upon this ſeveral of the Heads of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Factions Petitioned that Prince for Liberty: Their Petitions were received, and when He, in His Princely Wiſdom, though convenient, He commanded them to be read in Council; (the Petitioners daily attending,) and after it had been debated <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and he had heard all their Opinions, he then ſpake as followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, I ſhall not only declare my Opinion, but my poſitive Command, which I will have put in ſpeedy Execution, which is as follows, I will and require that Order be immediately given to write upon all the Gates of my Imperial City in Capital Letters, One God, One King, and One Religion; One God to be Worſhipped, One King to be Obeyed, and One Religion to be Practiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being ſpoken by the Prince, the Petitioners were ordered to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in, and this following Anſwer was given them, <hi>That the Princes Anſwer to their Petitions ſhould ſpeedily be Publickly known;</hi> This being ſaid they were ordred immediately to withdraw: This Command of the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in Execution, they immediately conformed thereunto, and all Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities were laid aſide, and every Perſon minded their own buſineſs, and left the Government of State-Affairs to thoſe to whom it belonged. From hence I infer it is Arrogant for any Perſon, be he whom he will, to intrench upon Prerogative, and it is better to be at the Princes diſpoſal than at any other Perſons whatſoever. For I do poſitively aver, that for any Perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs Command of his Superior, and without the knowledge of ſeveral other Perſons concerned, ſhall reject the Kings Letter, and ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhew reaſon for ſo doing, without acquainting thoſe who are equally concerned as well as his himſelf, is high Arrogance and Imprudence: It is of dangerous conſequence for any Perſon to intrench upon Royal Prerogative upon the ſcore of Suppoſition that ſome few former Loyal Actions may indemnife him; let all ſuch Perſons remember the Noble Peer was once Loyal, but afterwards proved a great Rebel. I have not in theſe Lines ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized any one particular Perſon, but if ſome, like the Auditors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he was Preaching, ſhall find themſelves pricked in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I ſhall hope theſe Lines may make a Reformation upon them; but on the other hand if any think themſelves unjuſtly cenſured, let them ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſo much in Print. I will atteſt what I have written with my own hand, in <hi>Conſpectu Solis,</hi> but at the preſent I judge it not ſo convenient to do it, leſt they ſhould ſay of me, as ſome have done of the late Vicar of <hi>Coſmus Blene</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that he Writes for preferment. I thank God I am content in the Station that He hath placed me in, but deſire no longer to Live than while I may be capacitated to ſhew my True Loyalty and Allegiance to my Prince, and my utter Abhorrence and deteſtation of all indirect ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, that are uſed to advance Self-Intereſt above Royal Prerogative: For if once a little part of a Hedge be broken down, it makes way for the ruin of the whole: I leave the Application thereof to thoſe whom it concerns. I have nothing farther to ſubjoyn but my hearty Prayer for the long Life of the King, and his Royal Brother, and the whole Family, which God grant. <hi>Vale.</hi>
